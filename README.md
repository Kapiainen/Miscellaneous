# Layout randomizer
A Rainmeter skin that loads a random layout from a predetermined list of layouts when the skin loaded.

## How to use
- Install like any other Rainmeter skin into a folder of your choosing in the `Skins` folder of your Rainmeter installation (e.g. `\Skins\Layout randomizer`).
- Add this skin to all of your layouts that you want to include.
- Edit the `tLayouts` table found in `\@Resources\Script.lua` so that it includes the names of your layouts.
- Load a layout and click on the *Activate* option from the skin's context menu (right-click on Rainmeter's tray icon > *Name of skin* > *Activate*).
